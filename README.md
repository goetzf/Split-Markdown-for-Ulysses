Python Script for Splitting Markdown files into smaller files and folders
based on header levels:  
  # Header 1 becomes numbered sub folders (groups),   
  ## Header 2 becomes numbered markdown files (sheets).

Main folder can then be draged into Ulysses archive, either "iCloud" or "On My Mac")

Handy when importing big projects from other Markdown sources.

Also generates combined .marked file to be opened in Marked 2.1
